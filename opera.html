<h5 ACT I - Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus></h5>

<h6 class="CHO name ch1">CHO</h6>
   <p class="song">Through the night, the constellations,
    Have given light from various stations.
    When midnight gloom falls on all nations,
    We will resume our occupations.</p>

<h6 class="SOL name ch2">SOL</h6>
    <p class="song">Our light, it's true, is not worth mention;
    What can we do to gain attention.
    When night and noon with vulgar glaring
    A great big moon is always flaring.
    MER. Home at last. A nice time I've had of it.</p> 

<p class="direction"> During chorus, enter Diana, an elderly goddess. She is carefully
        wrapped up in cloaks, shawls, etc.</p>

<h6 class="DIA name ch3">DIA</h6>
    <p class="speech">
    You young scamp you've been out all night again. This is the
    third time you've been out this week.</p>
  
<h6 class="MER name ch4">MER</h6>
    <p class="speech">Well you're a nice one to blow me up for that.</p>
  
<h6 class="DIA name ch3">DIA</h6>
    <p class="speech">I can't help being out all night.</p>


<p class="direction"> Enter Apollo. He is an elderly "buck" with an air of assumed
  juvenility and is dressed in dressing gown and smoking cap.</p>

    
<h6 class="AP name ch5">AP</h6>
    <p class="speech">Why they'veâ€”ha.ha.ha. they've made you the god of thieves.</p>

<p class="direction"> Fog clears away and discovers the scene described. Hurried
        music. Mercury shoots up from behind precipice at the back of
        stage. He carries several parcels afterwards described.  He sits
        down, very much fatigued.</p>

<h6 class="MER name ch4">MER</h6>
    <p class="speech">Very self denying of them.  There isn't one of them who
     hasn't a better claim to the distinction than I have.</p>
