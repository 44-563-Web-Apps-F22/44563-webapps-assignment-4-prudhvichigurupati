        <p class ="speech">They ought to be but they're not.  I'm treated abominably.
            I make everybody and I'm nobody.  I go everywhere and I'm
            nowhere.  I do everything and I'm nothing.  I've made thunder for
            Jupiter, odes for Apollo, battles for Mars, and love for Venus.
            I've married couples for Humen and six weeks afterwards, I've
            divorced them for Cupid, and in return I get all the kicks while
            they pocket the halfpence. And in compensation for robbing me of
            the halfpence in question, what have they done for me.</p>

        <p class="speech">Why they've—ha.ha.ha. they've made you the god of thieves.</p>

        <h6 class="MER name">MER</h6>
        <p class="song"> Oh, I'm the celestial drudge,
            For morning to night I must stop at it.
            On errands all day I must trudge,
            And stick to my work til I drop at it.
            In summer I get up at one.</p>
        <p class="direction">After song—very loud and majestic music is heard</p>
        <p class="direction">Enter Jupiter, an extremely old man, very decrepit, with very
            thin straggling white beard, he wears a long braided dressing
            gown, handsomely trimmed, and a silk night-cap on his head.
            Mercury falls back respectfully as he enters.</p>
        <h6 class="JUP name">JUP</h6>
        <p class="speech">Good day, Diana.  Ah, Apollo.  Well, well, well, what's the
            matter? What's the matter?</p>

        <h6 class="DIA name">DIA</h6>
        <p class="speech">Why that young scamp Mercury says that we do nothing, and
            leave all the duties of Olympus to him. Will you believe it, he
            actually says that our influence on earth is dropping down to
            nil.</p>

        <h6 class="JUP name">JUP</h6>
        <p class="speech"> Well, well. Don't be hard on the lad.  To tell you the
            truth, I'm not sure that he's far wrong. Don't let it go any
            further, but, between ourselves, the sacrifices and votive
            offerings have fallen off terribly of late. Why, I can remember
            the time when people offered us human sacrifices, no mistake
            about it, human sacrifices.  Think of that.</p>
